## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites 
To run the program, JRE version 1.8 or above. 

To work on it you'll need the corresponding JDK. 

### Installing 
If you're installing Java [Google](#googleItIKnowYouCan) is your friend

For finding and working with programs this program will try to execute 
them in the shell. If you're programs aren't in the `PATH` this 
program will assume they don't exist 

...TL;DR: make sure programs are in the `PATH`

### Configuring
